# Large-data-base-Code
This Python script generates a CSV file named large_dataset.csv with a header and 1,000 rows, where each row includes an incremental ID, a randomly generated floating-point value, and a description. It uses Pythonâ€™s csv module to write the file and the random module to create random values for testing data processing applications.
